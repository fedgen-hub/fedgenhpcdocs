Welcome to FEDerated GENeral “Omics”(FEDGEN) Cloud HPC Datacenter User documentation!
================================================================================

**About FEDerated GENeral “Omics” (FEDGEN)**
----------------------------------------------

The goal of the **FEDerated GENeral “Omics” (FEDGEN)** research project
is to develop ground-breaking research artefacts on federated cloud
computing, artificial intelligence and general “omics” for precision
medicine in Africa. The specific objectives are to address critical
issues in Africa on research capacity, large-scale research
infrastructure, early disease diagnosis, public health education, large
scale “omics” data storage/analysis and disease modelling.

We are continuously expanding our private High-Performance Computing
(HPC) infrastructure to implement the FEDGEN Datacenter and FEDGEN
Testbeds towards providing the required infrastructure for the stated
specific objectives. These infrastructures are revolutionising eHealth
research in Africa by providing robust platforms for storing and
analysing vast amounts of “omics” dataset that underlie malaria, breast
and prostate cancers. The cloud AI and advanced computing capabilities
enable real-time data processing, allowing researchers to gain rapid
insights into complex “omics” information and accelerate the discovery
of new treatments and therapies.

Check out our `website <http://www.fedgen.net>`_ for further information.

.. note::

   This project is under active development.
