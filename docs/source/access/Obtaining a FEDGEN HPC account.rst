**Inactivity Notice and Account Deletion Policy**

Accounts that have been inactive for a period of **one year** will be
flagged for deletion. This is to ensure that we are not storing unused
data and to avoid data being left without an owner.

account active. If no response is received within one month, the account
will be deleted, along with all associated data.
