**1.0 Introduction**
====================

**1.1 Technology Infrastructure for Online Course Delivery**
============================================================

The enabler for all online learning is technology. To make online
learning successful the technology must have several characteristics
that make the learners, instructors, managers and administrators
experience enjoyable. The technology should also not be in the way of
learning but transparently deliver a seamless experience.

Technology Requirements for online course delivery span hardware and
software and choices has to be made for either open source or commercial
on the software side and for either pre-built or custom solutions on the
hardware side dependent on certain needs assessment such as openness of
technology, technology accessibility, cost etc. Open Source presents a
cost-effective, value-driven alternative to commercial solutions and is
the recommended direction in most cases of online course delivery.
However a marriage of both worlds delivers the most effective solution.

The Technology Infrastructure (ICT needs) are outlined below:

**1.1.1 Lecture Capture & Processing**
--------------------------------------

   Lecture capture has to do with course creation, generating multimedia
   audio-visual resources. PowerPoint is the de-facto method of course
   presentations, however online learning has a unique need for video
   and thus a video capture studio entail. It is however recommended for
   course teachers to use the course creation module within LMS for an
   integrated experience and a PowerPoint/SCORM download for offline
   study. The following are the needs for effective Lecture capture &
   Processing.

Authoring Packages
------------------

   Enables Instructors to create true-to-live courseware that drives
   learners’ engagement from the comfort of their computer. There are no
   predominant open source in this space. Recommended options include;

- Adobe Captivate

- Articulate Studio (Recommended)

- Articulate Storyline

- Microsoft Office (Recommended)

**1.1.2 Lecture Capture Studio**
--------------------------------

   The lecture capture studio is a room(s) designated for recording of
   lectures or presentations with audio, video from a camera, computer
   screen so that online learners can a feel of a traditional classroom.
   The room may also be retrofitted with digital boards, Digitizers
   (Converts analogue writings to electronic) and visualizers (Captures
   instructors writing on paper live), Projectors, Document cameras (for
   Instances, where original document is non-electronic) etc. The most
   important piece of the capture studio is the capture software that
   combines the several inputs from several sources into a single
   integrated output that is then recorded and uploaded to the
   appropriate server. Dedicated room(s) or location(s) with proper
   studio setup for good video recording and audio capture. Lighting &
   Green Screen. Professional Audio Visual Systems & Consoles When high
   fidelity audio and video is required these is employed.

The following products are the industry leaders:

- Echo360 (Recommended)

- Mediasite

- Panopto

- Tegrity

- Matterhorn (open Source/custom)

- Catturavideo

In Covenant University, the Teledom Smart Class present us with a rare
opportunity to kick start the lecture capture with a little enhancement
on some required components. Presently, the smart class setup is able to
capture lectures but it is not able to convert, store and index recorded
videos in useable formats on different platforms.

The current system requires necessary integrations which could be
provided by any systems list above. On ODL we need to be able to
seamlessly integrate with platforms such as LDAP, the LCMS and also to
provide the needed platform for the mobile technology.

For the studio to be brought up to the required visual appeal, the need
to add light equipment and a proper stage (a Green Screen).

**1.1.3 Video Content Manager**
-------------------------------

The VCM tracks, catalogs and manages all video resources to be used on
the platform. Kaltura is the leading open source VCM platform and it is
the recommended platform. We currently have a running platform for
Hebron Tube but a new one would be installed.

**1.1.4 Multimedia Editing Suite & Workstation**
------------------------------------------------

Software and Hardware required to edit captured videos, annotate and
package multimedia contents

- Adobe CS6 (Recommended)

**1.1.5 Simulation System for Engineering Courses**
---------------------------------------------------

Some courses require unique visualization that extends beyond 2d
imagery, simulation systems provide a more connected and appealing
visual engagement for learners and better communicates the mind of the
instructors.

**1.1.5 Content Management System**
-----------------------------------

Content Management Systems is the unifying platform to store and
organize electronic materials for content reuse in the online learning
platform.

- Own Cloud (Recommended)

- Wordpress

**1.1.6 Encoder & Editing Suite**
---------------------------------

Provides required formats for video and graphics because multimedia has
huge impact on bandwidth, storage, and the hardware required to deliver
content.

**
**

**2.0 Administration System**
-----------------------------

The administration software system are custom programs for the
management of various features of the ODL initiative of student records,
the various stages of processing and throughout the entire lifecycle of
an ODL programme. The administration system includes the

- **Application/admission portal**: Prepares distance learners for
  admission into ODL. It is available but would require enhancement for
  better delivery for ODL purpose.

- **Student information system**: Formats all students’ records, faculty
  & staff engagements. It is available but would require enhancement for
  better delivery for ODL purpose.

- **Payment processor:** Collects and manages interfaces to funds. It is
  available (CUePay) but would require enhancement for better delivery
  for ODL purpose.

- **Pro-support:** Ticketing service and helpdesk with call center
  facility

- **Portfolio manager**

- **Identity Server:** Centrally manages all login credentials for the
  platform.

**2.1 Webportal (Website)**
---------------------------

Websites presents the first point of call to the ODL distance learning
initiative of the institution communicating the essentials and serving
as the guide to community & global interests.

**
**

**3.0 Lecture Delivery**
------------------------

Lecture delivery refers to unifying platforms that presents the courses
to students and allows interaction between the instructors and the
online learners. They include the following.

Learning Management System/Learning Content Management System (LMS/LCMS)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LMS/LCMS is the center of online learning delivery. It is where
instructors presents their courses for students to interact with.
Student attend class, follow-up lectures, relate with classmates and
lecturers, take tests, submit assignments and partake in team and
discussions. These systems are specifically designed to track the
performance of a multitude of learners and manage the entire experience
of online course delivery.

Recommended options include

- **Moodle**: Tried & Tested LMS platform. This is currently running

- **edX Open** : Based on the source code powering edx.org. still
  developing. This is also running but in “Test Phase”.

- **Instructure Canvas**: Modern approach to lecture delivery online
  with very good integration. This is a preferred option for ODL
  purpose.

**
**

**4.0 Live Collaboration Platform**
-----------------------------------

Provides the needed virtual meeting space for stakeholders to
communicate in **real-time** through chats, electronic mail, File
exchange, forums, blogs, web conference etc.

Google Apps (E-mail, Blogs, File Exchange, Social Network, Chat (Instant Messaging))
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Google Apps platform provides an all-in-one package for collaboration
   and it can be seamlessly integrated into the program.

**4.1 Web Conferencing System**
-------------------------------

Enables visual interaction and engagement between leaners and
instructors when required. The Teledom Smart Class only provide
teleconferencing and not web conferencing

- **BigBlueButton** open source conferencing platform is the recommended
  way to go. This currently running but requires hardware upgrade.

**4.2 Accessibility**
---------------------

- **Accessibility:** Since an ODL project targets educators and students
  worldwide, it is imperative that the site be accessible.

- **Diversity of platforms:** ODL sites need to deliver
  content that can be accessed by a diverse combination of browsers,
  operating systems and devices. In addition, all documents and other
  resources on ODL site should be readable without requiring any
  specialized software.

**4.3 Tablets**
---------------

For a complete experience of the lecture delivery as users are primarily
mobile these days.

**4.4 Assessment System**
-------------------------

In line with records, helps to determine performance of learners in a
course & effectiveness of course delivery. The leading for a secured
online test/assessment environment is “Respondus LockDown Browser” and
Monitor. It is a custom browser that locks down the testing environment
within Blackboard, ANGEL, Brightspace by D2L, Canvas, Moodle, and Sakai.
When students use Respondus LockDown Browser they are unable to print,
copy, go to another URL, or access other applications. When an
assessment is started, students are locked into it until they submit it
for grading.

**4.5 Plagiarism Checker**
--------------------------

To Checkmate plagiarism, Turnitin plagiarism checker would be used and
it’s currently in available in the university.

**5.0 Hosting Infrastructure**
------------------------------

Hosting infrastructure are IT equipment & resources resident in the
Datacenter/Network Operating Center that powers (“hosts”) the distance
learning program. Hosting can be done locally or through dedicated
online providers. Dedicated online (cloud) providers provides simplified
administration and reach however cost-effectiveness, value and security
of data are not fully guaranteed. They include;

**5.1 Internet Bandwidth**
--------------------------

- Bandwidth requirements can significantly increase immediately
  following program commissioning. This has implications on where the
  content delivery infrastructure is hosted thus dedicated internet
  links preferably over fiber is required for speedy access and
  delivery.

**5.2 Servers & Workstations**
------------------------------

High performance Rack mount or Blade Servers to run the program
application software. The workstations are Desktop computers to host
supporting applications and for management.

**5.3 Storage Server**
----------------------

Huge amount of data are generated in an online learning program
particularly when multimedia is involved. The storage server serves as
the central storage space to all the digital contents created apart from
storage space for server applications.

**5.4 Server Software**
-----------------------

They are underlying softwares on servers and workstations, which carries
out the huge task of “hosting” the ODL softwares. The virtualization
software would do an enormous task of reducing the several Server
hardware from about twenty (20) physical servers down to six or eight.

- **VMware vSphere for Virtualization**

- **Windows 2012 Server**

- **CentOS Server (open source)**

- **Ubuntu Server (open source)**

**5.5 ODL Metadata**
--------------------

Capturing robust metadata for content objects in ODL implementations
plays an important role in the following:

- **Helping visitors find their way through the content:
  **\ Descriptive metadata is information used to search the catalog of
  objects. Information describing the subject matter of objects, their
  creators and nature is captured to improve the end user’s the ability
  to discover the resources they require.

- | **Managing the publication of content:**
  | Operational metadata carries instructions for the organization of
    objects, their presentation, and relation to other
    resources. Technical information required to access and operate
    objects is captured to ensure the smooth functioning of the ODL
    system.

- | **Archiving content:**
  | Preservation metadata ensures the integrity and reuse of the
    educational resources over time. Further technical information is
    captured to secure the validity of objects, and to plan their
    migration through import/export to long-term repositories and other
    course development tools where they may be included in future
    educational resources.

**5.6 Metadata Standards**
--------------------------

Standard schemes for organizing metadata related to educational objects
have been established and are recommended for use on ODL projects.

- **1484.12.1 IEEE Standard for Learning Object Metadata**

- **Instructional Management Systems Metadata and Content Packaging
  Standard:** The IMS Global Learning Consortium develops and promotes
  the adoption of open technical specifications for interoperable
  learning technology. The IMS Learning Resource Meta-data Information
  Model identifies a subset of IEEE LOM meta-data elements to be used to
  describe learning materials in various types of learning systems.

The IMS Content packaging specification provides the functionality to
describe and package learning materials, such as an individual course or
a collection of courses, into interoperable, distributable packages.
Content packaging addresses the description, structure, and location of
online learning materials and the definition of some particular content
types. 

- **Shareable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM):** The Sharable
  Content Object Reference Model (SCORM) defines a Web-based learning
  "Content Aggregation Model" and "Run-Time Environment" for learning
  objects. The Content Aggregation Model was consulted in preparation of
  the COVENANT UNIVERSITY metadata implementation.

The following are ODL’s high-level technical requirements:

- Availability

  - External site () should always be available (over 99% up time)

  - Authoring site should be available 24 hours a day, 5 days a week.
    Weekend availability as needed (during peak publication cycles).

- Performance

  - Page size of HTML pages should be as small as possible (guideline:
    1MB)

  - Most pages within the authoring environment should load within five
    seconds

- Scalability

  - Support for 5,000 courses, 1 million documents (average size of 1024
    KB each)

  - Average size of each course = 125 MB

  - Authoring environment should support up to 500 concurrent users

  - Thousands of visitors per day for the external site. Millions of
    page views per month.

- Security

  - Internal content authoring environment uses integrated Windows
    authentication scheme. Active directory group membership dictates
    authorizations.

  - External site requires no login

  - Usual Web site security requirements for external site (firewalls,
    isolation of Web servers from the corporate network, Web server
    level access control lists, etc)

**5.7 COVENANT UNIVERSITY Site Structure:**
===========================================

The diagram below represents the COVENANT UNIVERSITY ODL site structure.
In addition to global pages (i.e pages such as About Us, the President's
Page, Help, etc), the COVENANT UNIVERSITY site contains department
pages and course sites. Each course is made of one or more sections.
Each section has a section home page (HTML page), other detailed HTML
content pages and associated resources (office documents, video files,
audio files, multimedia files, MATLAB files, Java applets, etc.)

- **Course planning application**

..

   Application used to manage the process of getting content from
   faculty to the content management system (CMS). This application
   manages the upfront planning portion of the ODL publishing process
   including identification of candidate courses, review and selection
   of courses for inclusion, faculty contact management, tracking of
   intellectual property (IP) rights concerns for each course,
   coordination of strategies concerning IP rights, and development and
   management of specifications for course construction.

- **Content management application (CMA)**

..

   The CMA is comprised of content authoring interfaces (usually
   implemented using content management templates), workflow to manage
   content lifecycle, document management interfaces, and relevant
   reporting functionality.

- **Content repository**

..

   The content repository is the central (and single) store for all
   content in the system. All content created in the system (regardless
   of the interface used to create it), is stored in the content
   repository. The repository ensures security and integrity of content.

- **Content delivery application (CDA)**

..

   The CDA is comprised of processes and interfaces required to extract
   content from the content repository and present it in media and
   interface appropriate for consumer of the content.

- **Content import and export functionality**

..

   Integration with institution's course management systems, content
   archival repositories and other sources/consumers of ODL content is
   achieved through the import and export functions

   For the COVENANT UNIVERSITY site, content import and export is
   implemented using IMS-compliant, XML content packaging standard (CDIF
   – Common Data Interchange Format) & SCORM (Shareable Content Object
   Reference Model).
