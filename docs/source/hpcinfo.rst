Our Cloud Resource Capacity
============================
  
The **FEDGEN** platforms not only enhances the efficiency of eHealth research but also democratises access to complex hardware and software tools, 
  enabling institutions and researchers, regardless of their locations or local resources, to participate in cutting-edge and large-scale 
  scientific studies. This fosters an inclusive research environment, which is essential for addressing the African diverse health challenges, 
scientific skills deficit and computational infrastructure. Ultimately, FEDGEN is set to revolutionise federated cloud computing, cloud AI 
and “omics” research in Africa that will lead to accelerated discoveries, and ultimately better health outcomes for millions of people. 
  Some of the FEGDEN related works that have been published in renowned outlets are found here.
